[{"content":"Intro Java is a very versatile and fast programming language. Knowing how to download Java can be extremely useful, especially when you want to do anything with Minecraft: Java Edition. I also recommend it as beginner language, as it teaches you concepts and syntax used in highly performant and robust languages.\nPrerequisites: This guide should be easy, only a basic knowledge of the command line is needed.\nLinux Install SDKMan To download, install, and manage JDKs, SDKMan is my favorite. SDKMan makes having multiple Java installations a breeze. To download and install SDKMan, run:\ncurl -s \u0026#34;https://get.sdkman.io\u0026#34; | bash Then, follow the helpful onscreen instructions and run:\nsource \u0026#34;$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh\u0026#34; Have SDKMan print out its version to make sure it works.\nsdk version Choose JDK If the latest version is all you want, thats easy. But, for many applications, you may need a very specific version (or you might just be picky, like me). To download the latest java version you could simply do:\nsdk install java But, if you are picky, you can view their whole catalog by running:\nsdk list java You will be greeted by the most varied list of JDK\u0026rsquo;s I have ever seen. Feel free to scroll through the list and find your favorite (or the one you need). \u0026#x1f604;\n// TODO Actually run this and explain scrolling picking ID\nInstall JVM Once you find the ID of the JDK you want. (I personally want 17.0.2-tem). It can be installed on your machine with the command below:\nsdk install java 17.0.2-tem When it prompts you if you want this to be your default, type Y to accept. This is not necessary, especially if you have multiple installs, but is extremely useful.\nYou did it! Now if you run:\njava -version It should print out its version!\nTips There are plenty of other features within SDKMan. Check out their documentation for all the tricks!\nRaspberry Pi For install instructions for Raspberry Pi, check out the Linux instructions as they are the same, except it will default to ARM when it downloads.\nConclusion I think Java is a great language, and having an easy way to install makes it even better. Huge shout-out to the creators of SDKMan, as they have saved us a huge headache! I hope this guide helped, and have fun! \u0026#x1f44b;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/Blog/posts/linux-install-java/","summary":"Intro Java is a very versatile and fast programming language.
