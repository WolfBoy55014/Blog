This is post shows off some of the formatting abilities and styles of PaperMod

```java
// This is some java code
for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

```python
# Here is some python
for i in range(7):
	print("Hello World!")
```

```shell
echo "Hello World"
```



That was a cool demo!

Now, I love Markdown, and many applications *(such as GitHub and Discord)* are adopting this simple, but flexible, formatting language. Now, I made this site using a framework called Hugo. Its super cool as it translates Markdown directly into static HTML websites in less than a second! This allows anyone to quickly write a Markdown file, and have it be made into a beautifully formatted webpage!

Now, you can get many, comunity-made themes for Hugo. I'm using PaperMod because of its sleek, modern feel and great customizability.
